# `PROJECT III` - Interactive MERN Stack Single-Page Application
​

> ## **`Project Description`**
​
For this project, we want to put all topics that were provided in our Bootcamp to practice by getting together as a team of soon-to-be developers.
The user story is to be determined and chose on our own to meet the requirements.

> ## `Project Requirements`
​
In creating our first collaborative MERN-stack single-page application, we will combine a scalable MongoDB back end, an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. We will continue to build on the agile development methodologies we’ve used throughout this course. These include storing our project code in GitHub, managing our work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.
​
The requirement must meet the following elements:
​
- **Use `React` for the front end.**
​
- **Use `Node.js` and `Express.js` server.**
​
- **Use `MongoDB` and the `Mongoose ODM` for the database.**
​
- **Use `queries` and `mutations` for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.**
​
- **Be deployed using `Heroku` (with data).**
​
- **Have a `polished UI`.**
​
- **Be `responsive`.**
​
- **Be `interactive` (i.e., accept and respond to user input).**
​
- **Include `authentication` (JWT).**
​
- **Protect sensitive API key information on the server.**
​
- **Have a `clean repository` that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).**
​
- **Have a high-quality `README` (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).**
​
> ## `Webpage Name`
​
FoodFix
​
> ## `Webpage Description`
​
Food Fix is an app that will invite many users to create and discover new recipes, so the same platform is meant to gather information to be re-used and innovate.
​
## `User Story`
​
```
As a user
I WANT to see new recipes and add my own recipes to the app,
SO THAT I can get an interactive experience when I search for new ideas to cook.
```
​
## `Acceptance Criteria`
​
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I open the website
THEN I see the recipes added and a submit form
WHEN I click on the website tabs
THEN I get directed to the menu section that I selected
WHEN I add information
THEN I am able to submit my recipe
WHEN I view the recipe card
THEN I can remove or like the content
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
